I'll ask you a question...

CHOICE: What would you choose? | Pack of gum | GOTO: *CHOOSE_GUM* | Watch | GOTO: *CHOOSE_WATCH*
  MARKER: *CHOOSE_GUM*
    COLLECT: 1
    GOTO: *FINISH_CHOICE*
  MARKER: *CHOOSE_WATCH*
    COLLECT: 2
    GOTO: *FINISH_CHOICE*
  MARKER: *FINISH_CHOICE*

OK, let me ask you another question then...

CHOICE: What would you choose? | Pack of gum | GOTO: *CHOOSE_GUM_1* | Watch | GOTO: *CHOOSE_GUM_1*
  MARKER: *CHOOSE_GUM_1*
    COLLECT: 1
    GOTO: *FINISH_CHOICE_1*
  MARKER: *CHOOSE_GUM_1*
    COLLECT: 2
    GOTO: *FINISH_CHOICE_1*
  MARKER: *FINISH_CHOICE_1*

Cool! Looks like that worked out ;)
C-ya later!
